\\n you told vs of some suite. what is't laertes? \\n you cannot speake of reason to the dane, \\n and loose your voyce. what would'st thou beg laertes, \\n that shall not be my offer, not thy asking? \\n the head is not more natiue to the heart, \\n the hand more instrumentall to the mouth, \\n then is the throne of denmarke to thy father. \\n what would'st thou haue laertes? \\n laer. dread my lord, \\n your leaue and fauour to returne to france, \\n from whence, though willingly i came to denmarke \\n to shew my duty in your coronation, \\n yet now i must confesse, that duty done, \\n my thoughts and wishes bend againe towards france, \\n and bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon \\n king. haue you your fathers leaue? \\n what sayes pollonius? \\n pol. he hath my lord: \\n i do beseech you giue him leaue to go \\n king. take thy faire houre laertes, time be thine, \\n and thy best graces spend it at thy will: \\n but now my cosin hamlet, and my sonne? \\n ham. a little more then kin, and lesse then kinde \\n king. how is it that the clouds still hang on you? \\n ham. not so my lord, i am too much i'th' sun \\n queen. good hamlet cast thy nightly colour off, \\n and let thine eye looke like a friend on denmarke. \\n do not for euer with thy veyled lids \\n seeke for thy noble father in the dust; \\n thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye, \\n passing through nature, to eternity \\n ham. i madam, it is common \\n queen. if it be; \\n why seemes it so particular with thee \\n ham. seemes madam? nay, it is: i know not seemes: \\n 'tis not alone my inky cloake (good mother) \\n nor customary suites of solemne blacke, \\n nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, \\n no, nor the fruitfull riuer in the eye, \\n nor the deiected hauiour of the visage, \\n together with all formes, moods, shewes of griefe, \\n that can denote me truly. these indeed seeme, \\n for they are actions that a man might play: \\n but i haue that within, which passeth show; \\n these, but the trappings, and the suites of woe \\n king. 'tis sweet and commendable \\n in your nature hamlet, \\n to giue these mourning duties to your father: \\n but you must know, your father lost a father, \\n that father lost, lost his, and the suruiuer bound \\n in filiall obligation, for some terme \\n to do obsequious sorrow. but to perseuer \\n in obstinate condolement, is a course \\n of impious stubbornnesse. 'tis vnmanly greefe, \\n it shewes a will most incorrect to heauen, \\n a heart vnfortified, a minde impatient, \\n an vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd: \\n for, what we know must be, and is as common \\n as any the most vulgar thing to sence, \\n why should we in our peeuish opposition \\n take it to heart? fye, 'tis a fault to heauen, \\n a fault against the dead, a fault to nature, \\n to reason most absurd, whose common theame \\n is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, \\n from the first coarse, till he that dyed to day, \\n this must be so. we pray you throw to earth \\n this vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs \\n as of a father; for let the world take note, \\n you are the most immediate to our throne, \\n and with no lesse nobility of loue, \\n then that which deerest father beares his sonne, \\n do i impart towards you. for your intent \\n in going backe to schoole in wittenberg, \\n it is most retrograde to our desire: \\n and we beseech you, bend you to remaine \\n heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye, \\n our cheefest courtier cosin, and our sonne \\n qu. let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet: \\n i prythee stay with vs, go not to wittenberg \\n ham. i shall in all my best \\n obey you madam \\n king. why 'tis a louing, and a faire reply, \\n be as our selfe in denmarke. madam come, \\n this gentle and vnforc'd accord of hamlet \\n sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, \\n no iocond health that denmarke drinkes to day, \\n but the great cannon to the clowds shall tell, \\n and the kings rouce, the heauens shall bruite againe, \\n respeaking earthly thunder. come away. \\n exeunt. \\n manet hamlet. \\n ham. oh that this too too solid flesh, would melt, \\n thaw, and resolue it selfe into a dew: \\n or that the euerlasting had not fixt \\n his cannon 'gainst selfe-slaughter. o god, o god! \\n how weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable \\n seemes to me all the vses of this world? \\n fie on't? oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded garden \\n that growes to seed: things rank, and grosse in nature \\n possesse it meerely. that it should come to this: \\n but two months dead: nay, not so much; not two, \\n so excellent a king, that was to this \\n hiperion to a satyre: so louing to my mother, \\n that he might not beteene the windes of heauen \\n visit her face too roughly. heauen and earth \\n must i remember: why she would hang on him, \\n as if encrease of appetite had growne \\n by what is fed on; and yet within a month? \\n let me not thinke on't: frailty, thy name is woman. \\n a little month, or ere those shooes were old, \\n with which she followed my poore fathers body \\n like niobe, all teares. why she, euen she. \\n (o heauen! a beast that wants discourse of reason \\n would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine vnkle, \\n my fathers brother: but no more like my father, \\n then i to hercules. within a moneth? \\n ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous teares \\n had left the flushing of her gauled eyes, \\n she married. o most wicked speed, to post \\n with such dexterity to incestuous sheets: \\n it is not, nor it cannot come to good. \\n but breake my heart, for i must hold my tongue. \\n enter horatio, barnardo, and marcellus. \\n hor. haile to your lordship \\n ham. i am glad to see you well: \\n horatio, or i do forget my selfe \\n hor. the same my lord, \\n and your poore seruant euer \\n ham. sir my good friend, \\n ile change that name with you: \\n and what make you from wittenberg horatio? \\n marcellus \\n mar. my good lord \\n ham. i am very glad to see you: good euen sir. \\n but what in faith make you from wittemberge? \\n hor. a truant disposition, good my lord \\n ham. i would not haue your enemy say so; \\n nor shall you doe mine eare that violence, \\n to make it truster of your owne report \\n against your selfe. i know you are no truant: \\n but what is your affaire in elsenour? \\n wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart \\n hor. my lord, i came to see your fathers funerall \\n ham. i pray thee doe not mock me (fellow student) \\n i thinke it was to see my mothers wedding \\n hor. indeed my lord, it followed hard vpon \\n ham. thrift thrift horatio: the funerall bakt-meats \\n did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables; \\n would i had met my dearest foe in heauen, \\n ere i had euer seene that day horatio. \\n my father, me thinkes i see my father \\n hor. oh where my lord? \\n ham. in my minds eye (horatio) \\n hor. i saw him once; he was a goodly king \\n ham. he was a man, take him for all in all: \\n i shall not look vpon his like againe \\n hor. my lord, i thinke i saw him yesternight \\n ham. saw? who? \\n hor. my lord, the king your father \\n ham. the king my father? \\n hor. season your admiration for a while \\n with an attent eare; till i may deliuer \\n vpon the witnesse of these gentlemen, \\n this maruell to you \\n ham. for heauens loue let me heare \\n hor. two nights together, had these gentlemen \\n (marcellus and barnardo) on their watch \\n in the dead wast and middle of the night \\n beene thus encountred. a figure like your father, \\n arm'd at all points exactly, cap a pe, \\n appeares before them, and with sollemne march \\n goes slow and stately: by them thrice he walkt, \\n by their opprest and feare-surprized eyes, \\n within his truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd \\n almost to ielly with the act of feare, \\n stand dumbe and speake not to him. this to me \\n in dreadfull secrecie impart they did, \\n and i with them the third night kept the watch, \\n whereas they had deliuer'd both in time, \\n forme of the thing; each word made true and good, \\n the apparition comes. i knew your father: \\n these hands are not more like \\n ham. but where was this? \\n mar. my lord vpon the platforme where we watcht \\n ham. did you not speake to it? \\n hor. my lord, i did; \\n but answere made it none: yet once me thought \\n it lifted vp it head, and did addresse \\n it selfe to motion, like as it would speake: \\n but euen then, the morning cocke crew lowd; \\n and at the sound it shrunke in hast away, \\n and vanisht from our sight \\n ham. tis very strange \\n hor. as i doe liue my honourd lord 'tis true; \\n and we did thinke it writ downe in our duty \\n to let you know of it \\n ham. indeed, indeed sirs; but this troubles me. \\n hold you the watch to night? \\n both. we doe my lord \\n ham. arm'd, say you? \\n both. arm'd, my lord \\n ham. from top to toe? \\n both. my lord, from head to foote \\n ham. then saw you not his face? \\n hor. o yes, my lord, he wore his beauer vp \\n ham. what, lookt he frowningly? \\n hor. a countenance more in sorrow then in anger \\n ham. pale, or red? \\n hor. nay very pale \\n ham. and fixt his eyes vpon you? \\n hor. most constantly \\n ham. i would i had beene there \\n hor. it would haue much amaz'd you \\n ham. very like, very like: staid it long? \\n hor. while one with moderate hast might tell a hundred \\n all. longer, longer \\n hor. not when i saw't \\n ham. his beard was grisly? no \\n hor. it was, as i haue seene it in his life, \\n a sable siluer'd \\n ham. ile watch to night; perchance 'twill wake againe \\n hor. i warrant you it will \\n ham. if it assume my noble fathers person, \\n ile speake to it, though hell it selfe should gape \\n and bid me hold my peace. i pray you all, \\n if you haue hitherto conceald this sight; \\n let it bee treble in your silence still: \\n and whatsoeuer els shall hap to night, \\n giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue; \\n i will requite your loues; so fare ye well: \\n vpon the platforme twixt eleuen and twelue, \\n ile visit you \\n all. our duty to your honour. \\n exeunt \\n ham. your loue, as mine to you: farewell. \\n my fathers spirit in armes? all is not well: \\n i doubt some foule play: would the night were come; \\n till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise, \\n though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies. \\n enter. \\n scena tertia \\n enter laertes and ophelia. \\n laer. my necessaries are imbark't; farewell: \\n and sister, as the winds giue benefit, \\n and conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe, \\n but let me heare from you \\n ophel. doe you doubt that?

what an asse am i? i sure, this is most braue, \\n that i, the sonne of the deere murthered, \\n prompted to my reuenge by heauen, and hell, \\n must (like a whore) vnpacke my heart with words, \\n and fall a cursing like a very drab. \\n a scullion? fye vpon't: foh. about my braine. \\n i haue heard, that guilty creatures sitting at a play, \\n haue by the very cunning of the scoene, \\n bene strooke so to the soule, that presently \\n they haue proclaim'd their malefactions. \\n for murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake \\n with most myraculous organ. ile haue these players, \\n play something like the murder of my father, \\n before mine vnkle. ile obserue his lookes, \\n ile rent him to the quicke: if he but blench \\n i know my course. the spirit that i haue seene \\n may be the diuell, and the diuel hath power \\n t' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps \\n out of my weaknesse, and my melancholly, \\n as he is very potent with such spirits, \\n abuses me to damne me. ile haue grounds \\n more relatiue then this: the play's the thing, \\n wherein ile catch the conscience of the king. \\n exit \\n enter king, queene, polonius, ophelia, rosincrance, \\n guildenstern, and \\n lords. \\n king. and can you by no drift of circumstance \\n get from him why he puts on this confusion: \\n grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet \\n with turbulent and dangerous lunacy \\n rosin. he does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted, \\n but from what cause he will by no meanes speake \\n guil. nor do we finde him forward to be sounded, \\n but with a crafty madnesse keepes aloofe: \\n when we would bring him on to some confession \\n of his true state \\n qu. did he receiue you well? \\n rosin. most like a gentleman \\n guild. but with much forcing of his disposition \\n rosin. niggard of question, but of our demands \\n most free in his reply \\n qu. did you assay him to any pastime? \\n rosin. madam, it so fell out, that certaine players \\n we ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him, \\n and there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy \\n to heare of it: they are about the court, \\n and (as i thinke) they haue already order \\n this night to play before him \\n pol. 'tis most true: \\n and he beseech'd me to intreate your maiesties \\n to heare, and see the matter \\n king. with all my heart, and it doth much content me \\n to heare him so inclin'd. good gentlemen, \\n giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on \\n to these delights \\n rosin. we shall my lord. \\n exeunt. \\n king. sweet gertrude leaue vs too, \\n for we haue closely sent for hamlet hither, \\n that he, as 'twere by accident, may there \\n affront ophelia. her father, and my selfe (lawful espials) \\n will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene \\n we may of their encounter frankely iudge, \\n and gather by him, as he is behaued, \\n if't be th' affliction of his loue, or no. \\n that thus he suffers for \\n qu. i shall obey you, \\n and for your part ophelia, i do wish \\n that your good beauties be the happy cause \\n of hamlets wildenesse: so shall i hope your vertues \\n will bring him to his wonted way againe, \\n to both your honors \\n ophe. madam, i wish it may \\n pol. ophelia, walke you heere. gracious so please ye \\n we will bestow our selues: reade on this booke, \\n that shew of such an exercise may colour \\n your lonelinesse. we are oft too blame in this, \\n 'tis too much prou'd, that with deuotions visage, \\n and pious action, we do surge o're \\n the diuell himselfe \\n king. oh 'tis true: \\n how smart a lash that speech doth giue my conscience? \\n the harlots cheeke beautied with plaist'ring art \\n is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it, \\n then is my deede, to my most painted word. \\n oh heauie burthen! \\n pol. i heare him comming, let's withdraw my lord. \\n exeunt. \\n enter hamlet. \\n ham. to be, or not to be, that is the question: \\n whether 'tis nobler in the minde to suffer \\n the slings and arrowes of outragious fortune, \\n or to take armes against a sea of troubles, \\n and by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe \\n no more; and by a sleepe, to say we end \\n the heart-ake, and the thousand naturall shockes \\n that flesh is heyre too? 'tis a consummation \\n deuoutly to be wish'd. to dye to sleepe, \\n to sleepe, perchance to dreame; i, there's the rub, \\n for in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come, \\n when we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile, \\n must giue vs pawse. there's the respect \\n that makes calamity of so long life: \\n for who would beare the whips and scornes of time, \\n the oppressors wrong, the poore mans contumely, \\n the pangs of dispriz'd loue, the lawes delay, \\n the insolence of office, and the spurnes \\n that patient merit of the vnworthy takes, \\n when he himselfe might his quietus make \\n with a bare bodkin? who would these fardles beare \\n to grunt and sweat vnder a weary life, \\n but that the dread of something after death, \\n the vndiscouered countrey, from whose borne \\n no traueller returnes, puzels the will, \\n and makes vs rather beare those illes we haue, \\n then flye to others that we know not of. \\n thus conscience does make cowards of vs all, \\n and thus the natiue hew of resolution \\n is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of thought, \\n and enterprizes of great pith and moment, \\n with this regard their currants turne away, \\n and loose the name of action. soft you now, \\n the faire ophelia? nimph, in thy orizons \\n be all my sinnes remembred \\n ophe. good my lord, \\n how does your honor for this many a day? \\n ham. i humbly thanke you: well, well, well \\n ophe. my lord, i haue remembrances of yours, \\n that i haue longed long to re-deliuer. \\n i pray you now, receiue them \\n ham. no, no, i neuer gaue you ought \\n ophe. my honor'd lord, i know right well you did, \\n and with them words of so sweet breath compos'd, \\n as made the things more rich, then perfume left: \\n take these againe, for to the noble minde \\n rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde. \\n there my lord \\n ham. ha, ha: are you honest?

i am my selfe indifferent honest, \\n but yet i could accuse me of such things, that it were better \\n my mother had not borne me. i am very prowd, reuengefull, \\n ambitious, with more offences at my becke, \\n then i haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue \\n them shape, or time to acte them in. what should such \\n fellowes as i do, crawling betweene heauen and earth. \\n we are arrant knaues all, beleeue none of vs. goe thy \\n wayes to a nunnery. where's your father? \\n ophe. at home, my lord \\n ham. let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may \\n play the foole no way, but in's owne house. farewell \\n ophe. o helpe him, you sweet heauens \\n ham. if thou doest marry, ile giue thee this plague \\n for thy dowrie. be thou as chast as ice, as pure as snow, \\n thou shalt not escape calumny. get thee to a nunnery. \\n go, farewell. or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool: \\n for wise men know well enough, what monsters you \\n make of them. to a nunnery go, and quickly too. farwell \\n ophe. o heauenly powers, restore him \\n ham. i haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough. \\n god has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another: \\n you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname \\n gods creatures, and make your wantonnesse, your ignorance. \\n go too, ile no more on't, it hath made me mad. \\n i say, we will haue no more marriages. those that are \\n married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep \\n as they are. to a nunnery, go. \\n exit hamlet. \\n ophe. o what a noble minde is heere o're-throwne?

\\n ham. sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting, \\n that would not let me sleepe; me thought i lay \\n worse then the mutines in the bilboes, rashly, \\n (and praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know, \\n our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well, \\n when our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs, \\n there's a diuinity that shapes our ends, \\n rough-hew them how we will \\n hor. that is most certaine \\n ham. vp from my cabin \\n my sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke, \\n grop'd i to finde out them; had my desire, \\n finger'd their packet, and in fine, withdrew \\n to mine owne roome againe, making so bold, \\n (my feares forgetting manners) to vnseale \\n their grand commission, where i found horatio, \\n oh royall knauery: an exact command, \\n larded with many seuerall sorts of reason; \\n importing denmarks health, and englands too, \\n with hoo, such bugges and goblins in my life, \\n that on the superuize no leasure bated, \\n no not to stay the grinding of the axe, \\n my head should be struck off \\n hor. ist possible? \\n ham. here's the commission, read it at more leysure: \\n but wilt thou heare me how i did proceed? \\n hor. i beseech you \\n ham. being thus benetted round with villaines, \\n ere i could make a prologue to my braines, \\n they had begun the play. i sate me downe, \\n deuis'd a new commission, wrote it faire, \\n i once did hold it as our statists doe, \\n a basenesse to write faire; and laboured much \\n how to forget that learning: but sir now, \\n it did me yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know \\n the effects of what i wrote? \\n hor. i, good my lord \\n ham. an earnest coniuration from the king, \\n as england was his faithfull tributary, \\n as loue betweene them, as the palme should flourish, \\n as peace should still her wheaten garland weare, \\n and stand a comma 'tweene their amities, \\n and many such like assis of great charge, \\n that on the view and know of these contents, \\n without debatement further, more or lesse, \\n he should the bearers put to sodaine death, \\n not shriuing time allowed \\n hor. how was this seal'd? \\n ham. why, euen in that was heauen ordinate; \\n i had my fathers signet in my purse, \\n which was the modell of that danish seale: \\n folded the writ vp in forme of the other, \\n subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely, \\n the changeling neuer knowne: now, the next day \\n was our sea fight, and what to this was sement, \\n thou know'st already \\n hor. so guildensterne and rosincrance, go too't \\n ham. why man, they did make loue to this imployment \\n they are not neere my conscience; their debate \\n doth by their owne insinuation grow: \\n 'tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes \\n betweene the passe, and fell incensed points \\n of mighty opposites \\n hor. why, what a king is this? \\n ham. does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon \\n he that hath kil'd my king, and whor'd my mother, \\n popt in betweene th' election and my hopes, \\n throwne out his angle for my proper life, \\n and with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience, \\n to quit him with this arme? and is't not to be damn'd \\n to let this canker of our nature come \\n in further euill \\n hor. it must be shortly knowne to him from england \\n what is the issue of the businesse there \\n ham. it will be short, \\n the interim's mine, and a mans life's no more \\n then to say one: but i am very sorry good horatio, \\n that to laertes i forgot my selfe; \\n for by the image of my cause, i see \\n the portraiture of his; ile count his fauours: \\n but sure the brauery of his griefe did put me \\n into a towring passion \\n hor. peace, who comes heere? \\n enter young osricke. \\n osr. your lordship is right welcome back to denmarke \\n ham. i humbly thank you sir, dost know this waterflie? \\n hor. no my good lord \\n ham. thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to \\n know him: he hath much land, and fertile; let a beast \\n be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the kings \\n messe; 'tis a chowgh; but as i saw spacious in the possession \\n of dirt \\n osr. sweet lord, if your friendship were at leysure, \\n i should impart a thing to you from his maiesty \\n ham. i will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put \\n your bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head \\n osr. i thanke your lordship, 'tis very hot \\n ham. no, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is \\n northerly \\n osr. it is indifferent cold my lord indeed \\n ham. mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my \\n complexion \\n osr. exceedingly, my lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere \\n i cannot tell how: but my lord, his maiesty bad me signifie \\n to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head: \\n sir, this is the matter \\n ham. i beseech you remember \\n osr. nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith: \\n sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is at \\n his weapon \\n ham. what's his weapon? \\n osr. rapier and dagger \\n ham. that's two of his weapons; but well \\n osr. the sir king ha's wag'd with him six barbary horses, \\n against the which he impon'd as i take it, sixe french \\n rapiers and poniards, with their assignes, as girdle, \\n hangers or so: three of the carriages infaith are very \\n deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate \\n carriages, and of very liberall conceit \\n ham. what call you the carriages? \\n osr. the carriages sir, are the hangers \\n ham. the phrase would bee more germaine to the \\n matter: if we could carry cannon by our sides; i would \\n it might be hangers till then; but on sixe barbary horses \\n against sixe french swords: their assignes, and three \\n liberall conceited carriages, that's the french but against \\n the danish; why is this impon'd as you call it? \\n osr. the king sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene \\n you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits; \\n he hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to \\n imediate tryall, if your lordship would vouchsafe the \\n answere \\n ham. how if i answere no? \\n osr. i meane my lord, the opposition of your person \\n in tryall \\n ham. sir, i will walke heere in the hall; if it please \\n his maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let \\n the foyles bee brought, the gentleman willing, and the \\n king hold his purpose; i will win for him if i can: if \\n not, ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits \\n osr. shall i redeliuer you ee'n so? \\n ham. to this effect sir, after what flourish your nature \\n will \\n osr. i commend my duty to your lordship \\n ham. yours, yours; hee does well to commend it \\n himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue \\n hor. this lapwing runs away with the shell on his \\n head \\n ham. he did complie with his dugge before hee \\n suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same beauty \\n that i know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of \\n the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of \\n yesty collection, which carries them through & through \\n the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow \\n them to their tryalls: the bubbles are out \\n hor. you will lose this wager, my lord \\n ham. i doe not thinke so, since he went into france, \\n i haue beene in continuall practice; i shall winne at the \\n oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about \\n my heart: but it is no matter \\n hor. nay, good my lord \\n ham. it is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of \\n gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman \\n hor. if your minde dislike any thing, obey. i will forestall \\n their repaire hither, and say you are not fit \\n ham. not a whit, we defie augury; there's a speciall \\n prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. if it be now, 'tis not \\n to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it \\n be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no \\n man ha's ought of what he leaues. what is't to leaue betimes? \\n enter king, queene, laertes and lords, with other attendants with \\n foyles, \\n and gauntlets, a table and flagons of wine on it. \\n kin. come hamlet, come, and take this hand from me \\n ham. giue me your pardon sir, i'ue done you wrong, \\n but pardon't as you are a gentleman. \\n this presence knowes, \\n and you must needs haue heard how i am punisht \\n with sore distraction?

\\n enter fortinbras and english ambassador, with drumme, colours, \\n and \\n attendants. \\n fortin. where is this sight? \\n hor. what is it ye would see; \\n if ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search \\n for. his quarry cries on hauocke. oh proud death, \\n what feast is toward in thine eternall cell. \\n that thou so many princes, at a shoote, \\n so bloodily hast strooke \\n amb. the sight is dismall, \\n and our affaires from england come too late, \\n the eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing, \\n to tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd, \\n that rosincrance and guildensterne are dead: \\n where should we haue our thankes?
